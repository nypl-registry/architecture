    <h1>Space/Time Directory Architecture</h1>
    <p>
      This diagram shows <i>current state</i> of the <a href="http://spacetime.nypl.org">Space/Time Directory</a> project technical architecture.
      The diagram shows how tools and components work together, and how they share data. It does not show the final state of the project â€” new blocks will be added as the project
      procedes and work is started on new datasets, data processing tools and user interfaces.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this diagram, only code and data components of the Space/Time Directory project are shown. Other, and equally important parts of the project (e.g. outreach, meetups, hackathons, collaborations),
      are (currently) not shown in this diagram.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finished components are <span class='legend-block finished-color5'>green</span>, components on which work has not started are <span class='legend-block finished-color1'>white</span>,
      and components on which we are currently working are shaded green according to their finished state. External, non-Space/Time components have
      a <span class='legend-block legend-block-external finished-color0'>dashed</span> line. For components with associated GitHub repositories, the number of open issues
      are shown in the <span class='legend-badge'>red</span> badges.
